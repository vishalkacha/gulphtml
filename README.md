# Interview: Front-end

### Background

This exercise is to test your Front-end skills. In this repository you will find:

1.  Project installation that you can setup with the instruction
    shared below.
2.  Link to Designs (PSDs and JPG files): [Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fCEq4JLqH5taSY21VS5vm3AjkOhOlVeH?usp=sharing).

Installation should configure everything you would need to get started theming based on the PSDs.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Browser: [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- Text editor: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/)

### Installation

- Install project dependencies using: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
- Install `gulp-cli` globally using `npm install -g gulp-cli`.

### Development

- Start the server using `gulp server`. This will also compile assets for you.
- Review the designs shared with you.
- Break the components as per [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
  into multiple templates that would be placed in the `templates` directory.
- Following the same pattern Sass can be broken into partials that can be placed in `sass` directory. For naming classes follow [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) and [BEM](http://getbem.com/).

#### Brownie Points for:

- Showcasing use of CSS Grids and Flex
- Addressing a11y issues
- Keeping things performant

### Submission
* Set up your github.com account if you don't already have one.
* Clone the repository
* Push your changes as a public repo in GitHub and submit the link
